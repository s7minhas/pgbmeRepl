	Abstract = { The author introduces a set of integrated developments in Web application software, networking, data citation standards, and statistical methods designed to increase scholarly recognition for data contributions; to put some of the universe of data and data-sharing practices on firmer ground; and to facilitate the public distribution of persistent, authorized, and verifiable data, with powerful and easy-to-use technology, even when the data are confidential or proprietary. The goal is to solve some of the political and sociological problems of data sharing via technological means, with the result intended to benefit both the scientific community and the sometimes apparently contradictory goals of individual researchers. },

Jordan investigates the effectiveness of leadership decapitation on terrorist groups by assessing the duration of the organization and its tactical capacity following an attack. Using an original data set (1945-2000) Jordan uses measures of group size, age, and organization type as her independent variables and argues that ideological organizations are weaker following decapitation than are religious ones, and younger and smaller organizations are more likely to cease activity following the targeted killing of leader (she measures her DV, effectiveness, in two ways: {F}irstly by group collapse/lifespan and secondly the group's capacity to carry out future attacks following the decapitation). She claims that leadership decapitation is an ineffective counterterrorism strategy because it does not increase the likelihood of the group's collapse. -Can't specifically at whether number of members increases (back lash recruitment) -Predicts individual head leader matters more than upper echelon members.
