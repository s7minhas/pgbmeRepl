\section{Conclusion}

Partial observability occurs whenever the observed graph is undirected yet the underlying process implies directed relationships. We introduced a model that can reconstruct the latent directed network ties, and illustrated its advantages on an example of bilateral trade agreements. The future work in this area could focus on several extensions. First, we accounted for network dependencies using bilinear mixed effects framework (GBME), which could be generalized using  the recently developed additive and multiplicative effects network model \citep{hoff:2015:arxiv,minhas:etal:2016:arxiv}. Second, estimating this type of network model in a fully dynamic setting (as opposed to slicing data by time, as we did here) remains a challenge, especially when the set of nodes changes in time.
